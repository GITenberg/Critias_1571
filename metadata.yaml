description: There is a well-known saying that the whole of Western Philosophy is
  footnotes of Plato. This is because his writings have set the schema that philosophy
  can be said to have followed ever since. Following the teachings of Socrates, Plato's
  works are among the world's greatest literature. This book provides a detailed description
  of Atlantis and its people as well as information about the ancient Athenians.
